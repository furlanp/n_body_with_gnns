# n_body_with_gnns

This is our project for MLG 2023/24.

We are trying to solve n-body problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem) with Graph Neural Networks.
Until now we have **tried** using GAT architecture (run test_gat.py), Interaction Networks (run test_it.py) and GNS (run test_gns.py).

GAT and GNS are working quite bad, while InteractionNetwork performs better under specific constraints. 
Example videos are available in the repository.
